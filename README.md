# Zoo-management-software

**How the software is processed?**

The software will make it possible to manage the zoo itself in terms of managing the cages and the animals themselves, both in terms of adding and removing animals, checking the food and water conditions in the animal cages while providing information about each animal.**

In particular, the project will also deal with zoo visitors, regular and V.I.P visitors, both in terms of adding and leaving the zoo, general details about all visitors And special details about the V.I.P visitors.
The software is intended for use by zoo managers or animal workers.

 **The programming structure:**
 
 The project has four sorted collections,

> 1. An array of length 5 containing the five cages in the zoo.
> 2. In everything there is a list of animals which is the second collection.
> 3. The third collection is a list containing the rules for visitors to the zoo at the given moment
> 4. And the fourth collection is a general list of the zoo's V.I.P guest rules (even those who are not necessarily at the zoo at the moment)
